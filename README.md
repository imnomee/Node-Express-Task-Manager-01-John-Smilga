We can add a simple task, edit the task, remove the task, mark as in/complete and view all the added tasks.

In order to install the app,
we will need to npm install the package dependencies from the package.json

To connected your own mongodb account with this app:
create a " .env " in the root of the app
inside the  " .env " create MONGO_URI variables
and set that to your own connection String from the MongoDB.
